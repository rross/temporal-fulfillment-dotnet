task queue name dupes
asp net worker runs async
web worker runs with env vars directly but worker runs with cmd args
add cmd line object for order json

signalling
cmd line takes signalling argument in each command even though its optional

can I make code cleaner in functions?
can I simplify somehow?
make sure remove anything that doesn't return .state
make sure I'm handling dicts and handle lists properly (don't dupe)

make a big page of status for all, in svelte? api->svelte?
    good templating if I return pure json
    then maybe interactive if time

TODO activities
    Maybe allocate retry in an activity
    pickItems(subOrder.Items)
    dispatch(address)
    confirmDelivery()

Absent namespaces e.g. order
Manual JSON parsing -- replace w/ record and consider using the sample at https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-dotnet/#data-conversion showing how to default to camel case

Enums for statuses

Send cancel instead of rollback signal
